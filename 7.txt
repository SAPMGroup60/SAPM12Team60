We represent the team SAPM Group 60 (MSc Students). 

We had six members in our group including the group leader (Angad Adivrekar)

The team members were very co-operative and contributed in a positive and enthusiatic way to complete the project. It was a pleasure working with the team. Yes, there were ups and downs while bringing the team to a consensus, but I think that's the consequence & fun of working in a team. 

The SAPM 60 team were - 

Angad Adivrekar - s1160184
Ankita Mitra -  s1149490
Athina Skandalou -  s1163185
Hao Zhao - s1149954
Jyothsna Shenoy - s1141601
Athanasios Nikoletopoulos - s1146566

I believe everyone has contributed in equal proportions to complete the project. So, I think the marks can be allocated equally among the team members. 

Hence, accordingly each team member will get 1/6 = 0.167.
