The cost estimation model used to determine the time estimates for this project is ※Wideband Delphi§ estimation model which was developed in the 1990s by Mary Sakry and Neil Potter of The Process Group [1]. 

Using this estimation model, the project developed a consensus about the estimates among the different teams who were involved in the development of the project. A work break down structure was developed during this model, which was used by team members to estimate the time taken to complete their respective tasks. The basic course of this estimation model can be listed as follows 每 
	
   1) Choose the team 每 The project manager forms a team of members from different teams involved in the project. A moderator was assigned who took care of monitoring the estimates. 	   	      We choose a team of 4 members, selecting 3 members from project management team, development and test team and a moderator. 

   2) Kickoff Meeting 每 A meeting was arranged between the team members under the supervision of the moderator. Various aspects of the project life-cycle were discussed and taking 	   	      into consideration all factors/tasks and a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) was created. 

   3) Individual Preparation 每 After the WBS is in place, each member of the team was given time to estimate for individual task in the WBS. Estimates were prepared based on prior 	  	      experience, knowledge and shortcomings. Any additional assumptions which were missed during the initial estimation are added to the WBS.

   4) Estimation Session 每 The moderator holds a meeting with all the members to bring a consensus on the estimated timescales defined for every task. This is an iterative process, 	   	      where the team members discuss whether they agree/disagree on the estimates, resolve issues and decide on one final estimate for each task. The cycle repeats until every 	   	      estimator doesn＊t want to change his/her estimates.

   5) Assemble tasks 每 The project manager now assembles all the estimates and prepares a final list of estimates, assumptions and tasks list.

   6) Review 每 The final step is to review the tasks list with the estimation team.


In this case, the team of making estimation includes all of us six members, because this can make sure that the estimation is based every one's experience, knowledge, and effort. About this project, to make a list of tasks has been done in the first step of the assignment through each member's effort. Every member estimates the time needed for addressing each task in terms of every one's experience, knowledge, special skill and shortcoming, etc. In the meeting held by the team leader, all members discuss the time each member estimated, then have a consensus on the estimation for each task. This is an efficient and practical model for estimation, especially, like our team that every one is not familiar with each other, no more than that a member can work out a estimation accepted by every one. Therefore, to let every one offer their opinion then discuss and reach the agreement is the most appropriate model for estimation in this circumstance.

Considering that the Wideband Delphi model requires the opinion of all the members, each team member independently should generate a set of preparation results, an estimate for each of the tasks and probable assumptions that the team member made in order to create stimates and any additional taks that should be included in the WBS but that the team missed during kickoff meeting. each team member builds preparation results by first filling in the tasks and then estimating the effort for each task. An estimate for each Task should be added to the TASKS TO ACHIEVE GOAL section of the preparation results, the TIME column should contain the estimate for each task
So each team member should have filled two forms like the following
