1} Make an account on GitHub.com

2} Please send me an email mentioning your account name, so that I can add you to the group

3} After I add you to the repository, you can now add/view/edit documents from the repository.

4} You can view the repository under "Account Settings" (visible on the upper right hand corner of the web page)--> Organizations-->SAPMGroup60

5} On the "Account Settings" page itself, add your "rsa_id.pub" key which you generated earlier for Gerrit.

6} After you drill down on the name of the repository, you will find the hyperlink for our repository on the lower right hand side called as "SAPMGroup60/SAPM12Team60"

7} Create a directory on your local drive using the command - mkdir SAPM12Team60

8} Enter this directory - cd SAPM12Team60

9} Now we need to clone the repository to our local drive - git init

10} We now need to set "origin" to the path of git repository, the command is as follows -

git remote add origin git@github.com:SAPMGroup60/SAPM12Team60.git

11} ALWAYS PLEASE PULL THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE RESPOSITORY BEFORE UPLOADING ANY CHANGES

command - git pull origin master

12} If you add a new file to the repository on your local drive and try to push the document without pulling the changes, you will not be allowed to do so. 

13} To push documents, perform "pull" first, add the file, commit changes and then the "push" command - 

git pull origin master

git add example.txt

git commit -m 'example'

git push origin master

14} Check on github whether the document is uploaded with your user name.

15} git log --after={2012-02-01} - to get entire log

14} Enjoy!!!
