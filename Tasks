Tasks
I noted some tasks that we should do in order to implement the required features.

1) Install the required software project management tools (build control, Revision control, Unit/regression testing, Bug/issue tracking, Documentation generation, Integrated suites).
2) Familiarize with the tools.
3) Gather the functionalities (We already have them).
4) Categorize them.
5) Use case diagram.
6) Use cases and descriptions.
7) Class diagram.
8) CRC cards. (Maybe we can skip that task).
9) Sequence Diagram
10) Activity Diagram
11) Implementation.
12) Testing.
