Tasks
I noted some tasks that I think we should do in order to implement the required features.

1) Project Planning
2) Recognise the software project (management) tools
3) Install the required software project management tools (build control, Revision control, Unit/regression testing, Bug/issue tracking, Documentation generation, Integrated suites).

2) Familiarize with the tools.
3) Gather the functionalities (We already have them).
4) Categorize them.
5) Use case diagram.
6) Use cases and descriptions.
7) Class diagram.
8) CRC cards. (Maybe we can skip that task).
9) Sequence Diagram
10) Activity Diagram
11) Implementation.
12) Testing.

Add tasks-subtasks
add architecture-design
justify the estimation of the tasks. for example, doing the A task took me 10 days because I hadn't done that before.
