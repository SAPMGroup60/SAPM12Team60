Tasks
I noted some tasks that I think we should do in order to implement the required features.

1) Install the required software project management tools (build control, Revision control, Unit/regression testing, Bug/issue tracking, Documentation generation, Integrated suites).
2) Familiarize with the tools.
3) Gather the functionalities (We already have them).
4) Categorize them.
5) Use case diagram.
6) Use cases and descriptions.
7) Class diagram.
8) CRC cards. (Maybe we can skip that task).
9) Sequence Diagram
10) Activity Diagram
11) Implementation.
12) Testing.

*************************************************************************************************************************

1} Project Planning
Determine project team
Decide on the hardware/software required (What interfaces, packages, applications will be required to implement the project).

2} Requirements Gathering

Creation of requirement specification document (FRS) from BRS (Business Requirement Specification)
Verify the requirement specification document
Preparation of use case/class/activity diagrams
Make sure the hardware/software is in place

3} Knowledge transfer sessions from BA to Dev and Test Team

Meetings to check if the understanding is correct (MOM)

5} Design of HLD and LLD documents – technical architect prepares both

6} Development of Prototype Env 

Online portal setup/website, creation and maintenance of databases, development of business logic (Workflow management)

7} Test Case Drafting & Test Plan Preparation

8} Actual development of Environment, in parallel with Regression testing

9} Unit testing of every module , in parallel defect finding and fixing

10} Integration test phase - internal

11} System test phase – defect finding and fixing

12} Integration test phase – – defect finding and fixing -- with external third parties

13} Code Deployment 

14} User acceptance (Customer Integration test performed on behalf of customer by third party users)
